<h3>The Story Behind the Word “Dirtiot”</h3>
<p><em>(Dirty + Idiot — but in silence, not insult)</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, I submitted my paper “Exploring Azerbaijani Verb Conjugation: A Comparative Study with French and English” to the Journal of Turkic Languages, accompanied by a respectful letter explaining my comparative methodology and the paper’s focus on filling grammatical gaps in Azerbaijani through logic and systematization.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours later, I received this response from Prof. Dr. Lars Johanson:</p>
<blockquote>“Your approach is personal as you point out. As such it has definitely a value for you, but it cannot be published in our journal… I send you here a link to an article on the Maku dialect.”</blockquote>

<p>He dismissed the core of the work—its comparative logic, grammatical contributions, and structural insights—reducing it to a personal reflection. I replied respectfully, clarifying that my paper was grounded in analytical reasoning, not anecdotal memory, and that the goal was to enrich linguistic theory, not merely reflect on dialects.</p>

<p>His final reply?</p>
<blockquote>“I recommend you to learn about what has been written by prominent scholars on Turkic verb systems.”</blockquote>

<p>And along with this sentence, he sent me a flood of links—all of them leading to his own work. Not one relevant comment on the actual content of my paper. Just dismissal and self-promotion disguised as advice.</p>

<h4>So I coined a term:</h4>
<h3>Dirtiot = Dirty + Idiot</h3>
<p>Not to insult, but to describe a structural pattern we often see in positions of power:</p>
<blockquote>When someone uses the polished image of academic authority to cover the dirt of arrogance, while expecting others to worship the very links that point only to themselves.</blockquote>

<p>This word came from an experience—but it belongs to a larger truth.<br>
And I will keep writing.</p>
