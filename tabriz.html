  <h1>Tabriz Was Bombed. But Why?</h1>

  <h2><em>A Reflection from South Azerbaijan<br>By Babak Jabbar Nezhad — Daş Maku, South Azerbaijan</em></h2>



  <p>In the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, a quiet but devastating question emerged — one that no analyst or government has dared to answer:</p>



  <p><strong>Why was Tabriz — the capital of South Azerbaijan — bombed more heavily than Tehran or even nuclear-armed Isfahan?</strong></p>



  <p>Israel’s stated aim was to neutralize Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure. Yet cities like Isfahan, home to central nuclear and command facilities, were barely touched — missiles there avoided urban areas altogether. Tehran, while heavily bombed, was still targeted less than Tabriz. And Tabriz itself, with no nuclear significance, faced some of the most intense destruction of the entire war.

 In Isfahan, the missiles avoided urban areas altogether. Only isolated military targets outside the city were hit.</p>



  <p>But in Tabriz, the story was different.</p>



  <p>Not only were small military zones struck — where many of the lower-ranking soldiers are themselves Azerbaijani — but even civilian areas were bombed. For instance, <strong>Tractor Sazi</strong>, a major industrial complex in Tabriz with no military affiliation, was targeted. The bombing pattern suggests that the logic of war was not nuclear containment, but <em>something else</em>.</p>



  <p>That “something else” becomes clearer when you understand the structure of Iranian military deployment.</p>



  <p>In South Azerbaijan, most of the local military personnel are ethnically Azerbaijani as the extreme majority of the population are Azerbijanis. While they serve under the national army, these soldiers are <strong>not loyal to the regime</strong> — and in moments of civil conflict, they have historically protected their own people. During the early stages of the 1979 Iranian revolution, when Kurds began attacking Azerbaijani civilians in the region, it was these military men who defended the people — not the state.</p>



  <p>Now consider this:</p>



  <p>In and around my hometown, <strong>Maku</strong>, Kurdish villages — with open support from Israel — were reportedly assembling <strong>drones</strong> during the war. Local residents confirm this. The implication was terrifying: if the war extended, these drones were intended to target <strong>Azerbaijani civilians</strong> (ten percent of the population in this area are Kurdish and the rest are Azerbijanis). This wasn't a defense operation. It was preparation for an <strong>internal ethnic conflict</strong> — one coordinated externally, aimed at destabilizing the region from within.</p>



  <p>So we must ask:<br>

  Was the bombing of Tabriz truly about Iran’s nuclear threat?<br>

  Or was it about <strong>disarming</strong> South Azerbaijan before lighting a <strong>second front</strong> inside the country — a front that pits armed Kurdish forces against a disarmed Azerbaijani population?</p>



  <p>Because let us not forget:<br>

  Kurds in the region are armed. Azerbaijanis are not.</p>



  <p>Now step back, and follow the logic to its darkest point.</p>



  <p>If Israel and the U.S. see strategic value in building a new Kurdistan in Iran — as they have pursued elsewhere — what better place to weaken first than <strong>South Azerbaijan</strong>? And who better to remove quietly than the very military forces who might protect their own people?</p>



  <p>And that brings us to a final, unavoidable conclusion:</p>



  <p><strong>Either Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev have sold South Azerbaijan to Israel and the U.S. —<br>

  or they’ve been duped.</strong><br>

  Fed illusions of regional power while the land they claim to protect is being bombed, softened, and fractured.</p>



  <p>The silence of the international community speaks volumes.<br>

  But the silence of Turkish and Azerbaijani leadership may speak even louder.</p>



  <p>Because while Tehran was spared, <strong>Tabriz burned.</strong><br>

  And we still wait for an answer.</p>
