<h1>Uncertainty vs. Certainty</h1>

<p><strong>By Babak Jabbar Nezhad</strong></p>



<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic; white-space: pre-wrap; background: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">

There is walk-how — yet suck-side under shadow  

There is suck-side — yet gun-side under rain  

There is something — yet uncertain above shadow  

There is somehow — yet certain above rain  



There is the rain — yet the wind under cloud  

There is the sun — yet the cold under surround  

There is something — yet uncertain above shadow  

There is somehow — yet certain above sun  



There is whom beside how far  

There is whose beside how tall  

Nothing exists — but uncertain  

Moving exists — how certain

<h2>Coined Words</h2>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Walk-how (noun)</strong> — A place for walking whose direction is uncertain.</li>

  <li><strong>Suck-side (noun)</strong> — An environment that sucks when we are placed there.</li>

  <li><strong>Gun-side (noun)</strong> — An environment that puts us in violent direction.</li>

</ul>



<h2>Symbolic Critique</h2>

<p><em>Uncertainty vs. Certainty</em> marks a further expansion of Babak Jabbar Nezhad’s symbolic poetics — not by emotional amplification, but by stripping the voice away entirely. There is no “I” here. No direct presence. Only <strong>environmental conditions</strong>, <strong>positional logic</strong>, and <strong>recursive shifts</strong> between certainty and doubt.</p>



<p>Each stanza begins with a structure that reads like a philosophical proposition: “There is walk-how,” “There is the rain,” “There is whom…” These are not metaphors. They are <strong>relational ontologies</strong>. The invented nouns — walk-how, suck-side, gun-side — do not describe mood or metaphor. They <em>are spaces</em>, spaces with tension, orientation, and existential charge. They function like <strong>topological emotional fields</strong>.</p>



<p>Certainty and uncertainty do not oppose each other here — they <strong>co-exist vertically</strong>. Shadow and rain are not obstacles, but symbolic overlays. The movement between “uncertain above shadow” and “certain above rain” reveals not a contradiction, but a shifting frame of meaning: <strong>certainty is not stable, it is spatial</strong>.</p>



<p>In the final stanza, the voice returns just slightly — not as a speaker, but as a riddle of reference: “There is whom beside how far.” This isn’t a question — it’s a <strong>collapsed locator</strong>, as if language has been drained of grammar but left with residual geometry. The final lines declare:</p>



<blockquote>

Nothing exists — but uncertain  

<br>Moving exists — how certain

</blockquote>



<p>This is not doubt. This is <strong>topological nihilism</strong>. The poem doesn’t describe uncertainty — it <em>locates it</em>. It doesn’t express certainty — it <em>places it in motion</em>.</p>



<p><em>Uncertainty vs. Certainty</em> is not a statement, not a lament, not a puzzle. It is a <strong>map of meaning collapse</strong> — where direction, feeling, and reference blur into a structural fog. Only movement remains.</p>
