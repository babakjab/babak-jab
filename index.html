<h1>Babak Jabbar Nezhad</h1>

<p>

I‚Äôm a mathematician, philosopher, and independent researcher from Da≈ü Maku, West Azerbaijan.<br>

My work spans mathematical logic, linguistics, psychology, and cosmology ‚Äî with a critical focus on structural truth beyond conventional academic frameworks.<br>

I‚Äôve published 22 research papers, several of which introduce original logical frameworks (such as the Parallel Law of Excluded Middle), linguistic reconstructions in Azerbaijani, and new models of emotional intelligence.<br>

I also write poetry in Azerbaijani, English, French, and Turkish, blending structure with inner voice.

<h2>üîç Critiques & Coined Words</h2>

<h3>The Story Behind the Word ‚ÄúDirtiot‚Äù</h3>

<p><em>(Dirty + Idiot ‚Äî but in silence, not insult)</em></p>



<p>A few months ago, I submitted my paper ‚ÄúExploring Azerbaijani Verb Conjugation: A Comparative Study with French and English‚Äù to the Journal of Turkic Languages, accompanied by a respectful letter explaining my comparative methodology and the paper‚Äôs focus on filling grammatical gaps in Azerbaijani through logic and systematization.</p>



<p>Less than 24 hours later, I received this response from Prof. Dr. Lars Johanson:</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúYour approach is personal as you point out. As such it has definitely a value for you, but it cannot be published in our journal‚Ä¶ I send you here a link to an article on the Maku dialect.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>He dismissed the core of the work‚Äîits comparative logic, grammatical contributions, and structural insights‚Äîreducing it to a personal reflection. I replied respectfully, clarifying that my paper was grounded in analytical reasoning, not anecdotal memory, and that the goal was to enrich linguistic theory, not merely reflect on dialects.</p>



<p>His final reply?</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúI recommend you to learn about what has been written by prominent scholars on Turkic verb systems.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>And along with this sentence, he sent me a flood of links ‚Äî all of them leading to his own work. Not one relevant comment on the actual content of my paper. Just dismissal and self-promotion disguised as advice.</p>



<h4>So I coined a term:</h4>

<h3>Dirtiot = Dirty + Idiot</h3>

<blockquote>When someone uses the polished image of academic authority to cover the dirt of arrogance, while expecting others to worship the very links that point only to themselves.</blockquote>



<p>This word came from an experience ‚Äî but it belongs to a larger truth.<br>

And I will keep writing.</p>
