    <h1>When Light Fails: Testimony from a Broken Grid</h1>



    <h2>1. A Lamp Above Our Heads</h2>

    <p>We do not fear the dark.<br>

    We fear what it brings.</p>



    <p>In a small room in Maku, a family sits beneath a broken lamp — cracked, heavy, glowing like a threat. It looks like a monster, ready to explode. Inside the room, a little girl runs to her father’s arms, trembling. The father holds her. The lamp may burst. Everyone watches — mother, son, daughter, father — not as a family, but as witnesses waiting for judgment.</p>



    <p>This is not metaphor. This is their ceiling.</p>



    <h2>2. Six Hours Without Breath</h2>

    <p>Electricity is not just about light. It is about air, breath, safety, and time.<br>

    In Maku, the government’s “love” means six hours of blackout each day — triple the national average. There is no schedule. The man in the electricity office cuts power as he wishes.</p>



    <p>When the electricity dies:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Elevators stop between floors</li>

        <li>Oxygen machines fail</li>

        <li>Card readers in shops go silent</li>

        <li>ATMs spit out two dollars — barely enough for bread</li>

        <li>Refrigerators melt</li>

        <li>Clinics close</li>

        <li>And lives tremble</li>

    </ul>



    <p>My aunt’s 80-year-old husband — who can barely walk — got trapped between floors. When they pulled him out, his arm was bleeding. The next day, he put on a clean shirt. My aunt said, “Be careful — it’s bloody.”<br>

    He answered, “It’s okay.”<br>

    Because here, this is okay. This is how we live.</p>



    <h2>3. Bumps, Stairs, and Silent Screams</h2>

    <p>What is abnormal in other countries is normal in Iran.</p>



    <p>In every 100 meters of Maku’s streets, there is a giant speed bump — huge, irregular, aggressive. These are not tools for safety. They are weapons of laziness. Instead of officers controlling cars, they installed pain on the road.</p>



    <p>I’ve felt that pain.<br>

    When we took my mother — post-knee surgery — to Tabriz in an ambulance, every bump sent shockwaves through her healing body. She groaned. We held her. But the road held nothing back.</p>



    <p>Medical buildings are no better. Most have stairs. Orthopedic doctors — whose patients cannot walk — rent offices on the second floor. Radiologists — who serve the injured — work in basements. I once carried my mother, in a wheelchair, down those stairs to reach radiography. Three men helped. It was not an emergency. It was routine.</p>



    <p>I once took my father, stiff with Parkinson’s, to a neurologist in Urmia. He could barely walk. But the doctor’s office stood above him, at the top of a staircase.</p>



    <p>Why? Because doctors in Iran are no longer healers. They are businessmen. They choose where rent is cheap, not where patients can reach.</p>



    <h2>4. The Meaning of Normal</h2>

    <p>So when my aunt’s husband shrugs off the blood on his shirt, it is not apathy. It is survival.</p>



    <p>He knows the system is broken — and he has lived long enough to stop resisting.<br>

    In Iran, the abnormal has become ordinary.</p>



    <p>Suffering is not an event. It is a pattern. A rhythm. A heartbeat.<br>

    We don’t file lawsuits. We don’t demand better elevators. We adapt. We improvise.<br>

    We memorize ATM hours. We ride shock-bumps in ambulances.<br>

    We fear light because it might explode.<br>

    We carry wheelchairs down staircases built by the uncaring.</p>



    <p>And through it all — we still dress our wounds, and say:<br>

    “It’s okay.”</p>



    <p><em>But it is not okay.<br>

    It only feels like it.</em></p>
