  <h1>🧩 Puzzle of Unitization</h1>

  <p><em>By Babak Jabbar Nezhad</em></p>



  <div class="poem">

She, he, they — I — go for it — them  

I saw, see — will I? — go for it — them  

Until then? Until when? Until where?  

Unitized — till what? Until where?



She died, he shined, they hired — I hide  

She sees, he saw, they shined — I hide  

Till streets of highways on yell — I hide  

Till sunshine of oceans on sell — I hide



She gained, he served — till where?  

They heyed, I yelled — till where?  

Hey … hey … yell … yell …  

Till one say hey — yell



Unitize — maybe — spread  

Till far —

    <h2>📚 Poetic-Philosophical Critique</h2>

    <p>

      This poem is not a narrative — it is a compression. It encodes how identity is formed through entangled fragments: social phrases, self-reflections, suppressed emotions, and recursive dissonance. It is written not from outside the mind but from within the **unitization process** — the attempt to unify chaos into form.

    </p>



    <p>

      The first stanza contains not full ideas but snippets, shards, and coded phrases. Words like “she,” “he,” “they,” “I,” repeated in varying structures, function like compressed memory traces. These fragments don’t clarify identity — they interfere with each other. They form a kind of **temporal interference pattern** in the brain.

    </p>



    <p>

      The second stanza marks the emergence of **emotion** and **agency**. Verbs appear: “died,” “shined,” “hired.” Yet the repeated refrain is “I hide.” The subject absorbs the world’s activity but does not release anything outward. This internalizes pain, thought, and speech into **layers of silent processing**. 

    </p>



    <p>

      The third stanza reaches a surreal crescendo — sound fragments (hey, yell) collapse into rhythm without meaning, language without syntax. This is **symbolic recursion**, where emotional codes and social signals repeat until they break into pure noise.

    </p>



    <p>

      The final line, “Till far —”, is not just unfinished — it is the exit wound of meaning itself. Nothing is resolved. Everything is in motion.

    </p>



    <p>

      The poem uses <strong>minimal natural language</strong> but creates **multi-layered symbolic structure** through:

      <ul>

        <li>Compression of social phrases into logical fragments,</li>

        <li>Recursive interaction of past/present/future tenses,</li>

        <li>Coined spatial terms that encode emotional position,</li>

        <li>A collapsing rhythm that mirrors cognitive overload,</li>

        <li>Intentional ambiguity in phrase targeting, to reflect internal confusion.</li>

      </ul>

    </p>



    <p>

      It does not imitate known poetic forms. Instead, it generates a new mode of expression: **logical-poetic recursion as identity structure**.
