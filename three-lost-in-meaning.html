<h1>Three Lost in Meaning</h1>

<p><strong>By Babak Jabbar Nezhad</strong></p>



<div class="poem">

Someone said: who you are? I am the heart-aged  

Someone said: who am I? You are the ash-aged  

I — how said: who you are? This is the long-aged  

I — tough said: who am I? This is the short-aged  



Then — you said: yes I am. I am the heart-set  

Hence — you said: yes you are. You are the dark-set  

I — right said: how you are? To be hang-set  

I — what said: how am I? To be heart-set  



Someone — yet said: Where is the box?  

I — far said: Where is the rank?  

You — yet said: Where is the far?  

I — yet said: Where is the hall?

<h2>Structural Collapse and Symbolic Echo: A Companion to POOCH II</h2>

<p><em>Three Lost in Meaning</em> is not an illustration of nihilism — it is its <strong>architectural embodiment</strong>. If <em>POOCH II</em> theorizes the fragility of inherited meaning through conditional structures, then this poem <strong>enacts that collapse</strong> through fractured identity, recursive speech, and spatial disorientation.</p>



<p>Each stanza is a <strong>layer of destabilization</strong>. The first speaks in a broken grammar of identity — names like <em>heart-aged</em> and <em>ash-aged</em> replace coherent selfhood with emotionally coined durations. But the syntax is already drifting: “I — how said” is not confusion; it is the moment when <strong>the speaker becomes unstable within their own utterance</strong>.</p>



<p>The second stanza enters <strong>emotional positioning</strong>: heart-set, dark-set, back-set. These are not traits, but states of symbolic fixity — showing how identity, once shattered, tries to <strong>re-anchor in unstable emotional ground</strong>. But even this collapses by the third stanza.</p>



<p>And there, in the final movement, the poem achieves its most radical act: it <strong>lets meaning fall through space</strong>. “Where is the box? Where is the far?” These are not questions of place — they are <strong>echoes of vanished structure</strong>. The repetition of “yet” and “far” as speakers becomes a symbolic recursion: a questioning that <strong>erases its own anchor</strong>.</p>



<p>This is not poetic pessimism. It is <strong>mathematical nihilism</strong> rendered as symbolic form — a deconstruction not of beauty, but of stability. It mirrors <em>POOCH II</em> in every way, but speaks in a language only the void can answer.</p>



<p><strong>Three Lost in Meaning</strong> is not a companion to <em>POOCH II</em> by theme — it is its <strong>shadow</strong>, its <strong>collapse</strong>, its <strong>final music</strong> after the scaffolding has fallen.</p>
