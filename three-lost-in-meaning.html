<div class="poem">

Someone said: who you are? I am the heart-aged  

Someone said: who am I? You are the ash-aged  

I — how said: who you are? This is the long-aged  

I — tough said: who am I? This is the short-aged  



Then — you said: yes I am. I am the heart-set  

Hence — you said: yes you are. You are the dark-set  

I — right said: how you are? To be hang-set  

I — what said: how am I? To be heart-set  



Someone — yet said: Where is the box?  

I — far said: Where is the rank?  

You — yet said: Where is the far?  

I — yet said: Where is the hall?

<h2>Structural Collapse and Symbolic Echo: A Companion to POOCH II</h2>

<p><em>Three Lost in Meaning</em> is not an illustration of nihilism — it is its <strong>architectural embodiment</strong>. If <em>POOCH II</em> theorizes the fragility of inherited meaning through conditional structures, then this poem <strong>enacts that collapse</strong> through fractured identity, recursive speech, and spatial disorientation.</p>



<p>Each stanza is a <strong>layer of destabilization</strong>. The first speaks in a broken grammar of identity — names like <em>heart-aged</em> and <em>ash-aged</em> replace coherent selfhood with emotionally coined durations. But the syntax is already drifting: “I — how said” is not confusion; it is the moment when <strong>the speaker becomes unstable within their own utterance</strong>.</p>



<p>The second stanza enters <strong>emotional positioning</strong>: heart-set, dark-set, back-set. These are not traits, but states of symbolic fixity — showing how identity, once shattered, tries to <strong>re-anchor in unstable emotional ground</strong>. But even this collapses by the third stanza.</p>



<p>And there, in the final movement, the poem achieves its most radical act: it <strong>lets meaning fall through space</strong>. “Where is the box? Where is the far?” These are not questions of place — they are <strong>echoes of vanished structure</strong>. The repetition of “yet” and “far” as speakers becomes a symbolic recursion: a questioning that <strong>erases its own anchor</strong>.</p>



<p>This is not poetic pessimism. It is <strong>mathematical nihilism</strong> rendered as symbolic form — a deconstruction not of beauty, but of stability. It mirrors <em>POOCH II</em> in every way, but speaks in a language only the void can answer.</p>



<p><strong>Three Lost in Meaning</strong> is not a companion to <em>POOCH II</em> by theme — it is its <strong>shadow</strong>, its <strong>collapse</strong>, its <strong>final music</strong> after the scaffolding has fallen.</p>

<h3>Layered Minimalism: Semantic Compression and Symbolic Drift</h3>
<p>
One final structure must be named: this poem does not rely on abundance. It uses <strong>minimal words</strong> to construct <strong>multi-layered symbolic density</strong> — a method more commonly found in mathematics than in language.
</p>

<p>
The first layer emerges through <strong>coined words</strong>: <em>heart-aged</em>, <em>ash-aged</em>, <em>dark-set</em>, <em>hang-set</em>. These are not metaphorical — they are <strong>emotional constants</strong>, invented not to describe but to <em>define</em>. They act like axioms inside a symbolic logic of identity.
</p>

<p>
The second layer arises through <strong>structure</strong>: each stanza uses four compact lines that repeat patterns of questioning — <em>“who you are?”</em>, <em>“how am I?”</em>, <em>“where is the...?”</em>. This rhythm appears formal, but it decays as the stanzas progress — a mirror that reflects nothing back. Structure here is not stability. It is <strong>ritual erosion</strong>.
</p>

<p>
But the final layer is perhaps the most subtle: the use of <strong>non-coined words</strong> — <em>box</em>, <em>rank</em>, <em>far</em>, <em>hall</em> — in the final stanza. These ordinary nouns, placed after invented constructs, suddenly feel abstract, hollow, and unstable. They become <strong>semantic shells</strong> — echoes of meaning that once held something but now drift in symbolic space. It is through these common words that the deepest void is reached.
</p>

<p>
This reverse progression — from invented meaning to structural recursion to stripped-down language — reveals the poem’s final technique: <strong>semantic compression followed by conceptual evaporation</strong>. Meaning is not denied. It is <em>reduced, questioned, and quietly dismantled</em>.
</p>

<p>
Only a poet who thinks like a mathematician could build such a structure. And only a reader willing to sit in silence will hear it collapse.
